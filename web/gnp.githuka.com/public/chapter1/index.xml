      <description>The vehicle&amp;rsquo;s 12V power system is the primary source of electromotive force that is requred to operate most loads in the vehicle. Since the loads varry in resistance, the current drawn is also a variable and changes depending on the load turned on. The source of this energy is the 12V Lead Acid Battery and the alternator. These work in charging and discharging states.</description>

      <description>The car battery is a flooded lead acid battery. It consists of a Lead -ve electrode and a Lead Dioxide +ve electrode dipped in an electrolyte made of dilute sulphiric acid. The plates separator is made of a glass fibre which is essentially Silicon Dioxide. The outercase is made of ABS plastic. On most batteries the terminals are made of silver-coated copper.
Voltage Stats  Capacity: 12V, 40-46Ah Starting Current: 380-490A Fully Charged: 12.</description>
