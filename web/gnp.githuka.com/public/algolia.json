The Nissan Note E11 2008 Model is a 5 door mini MPV hatchback manufactured by Nissan Japan.\nLatest Project Updates  2022-02-28: Move site to https://gnp.githuka.com  TODO Nissan Note E11 Details  Make: Nissan Note Model: DBA E11 Engine: HR Type Engine Capacity: 1490 cc  Safety is Important This is a research project and the vehicle above has been modified to perform what you see in this project. Do not attempt to replicate what you see here on your car. It can result in voiding your vehicle\u0026amp;rsquo;s warranty, insurance or even cause injury. Consult a professional vehicle service shop when in doubt. Keep your eyes on the road at all times and follow the rules of the road.\nElectrical Safety  The starting current of the starter can reach upto 120A DC. This is very dangerous. Do not short circuit the battery terminals. Do not leave the car battery at a lower voltage for too long. Have a secondary battery to power your peripherals. Leave the primary battery just for starting the engine.

Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.\nPossible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, and connected vehicle platoons.Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development, but there are no self-driving cars available for everyday consumers.\n","date":1572103575,"description":"","lastmod":"2019-10-26T15:26:15Z","objectID":"b97d32ded491105d9cd6fb8b493f82a0","permalink":"https://gnp.githuka.com/getting-started/autonomous/","publishdate":"2019-10-26T15:26:15Z","title":"Autonomous Vehicles"},{"content":"Connected vehicles are cars which can be able to bi-directionally share data with their surroundings. The cars can be able to talk with various systems around them.\nConnetivity Modes  V2I \u0026amp;ldquo;Vehicle to Infrastructure\u0026amp;rdquo;: The technology captures data generated by the vehicle and provides information about the infrastructure to the driver. The V2I technology communicates information about safety, mobility or environment-related conditions. V2V \u0026amp;ldquo;Vehicle to Vehicle\u0026amp;rdquo;: The technology communicates information about speed and position of surrounding vehicles through a wireless exchange of information. The goal is to avoid accidents, ease traffic congestions and have a positive impact on the environment. V2C \u0026amp;ldquo;Vehicle to Cloud\u0026amp;rdquo;: The technology exchanges information about and for applications of the vehicle with a cloud system. This allows the vehicle to use information from other, though the cloud connected industries like energy, transportation and smart homes and make use of IoT. V2P \u0026amp;ldquo;Vehicle to Pedestrian\u0026amp;rdquo;: The technology senses information about its environment and communicates it to other vehicles, infrastructure and personal mobile devices. This enables the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and is intended to improve safety and mobility on the road. V2X \u0026amp;ldquo;Vehicle to Everything\u0026amp;rdquo;: The technology interconnects all types of vehicles and infrastructure systems with another. This connectivity includes cars, highways, ships, trains and airplanes.  Connected vehicles can also use wireless communication to “talk” to traffic signals, work zones, toll booths, school zones, and other types of infrastructure. The vehicle information communicated is anonymous, so vehicles cannot be tracked and the system is secure against tampering.\nReferences  Wikipedia - Connected Car  ","date":1642346775,"description":"","lastmod":"2022-02-22T11:26:15Z","objectID":"f3384bc95f5b8ed7a8e1f18f216f2e8d","permalink":"https://gnp.githuka.com/getting-started/connected_vehicle/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T15:26:15Z","title":"Connected Vehicles"},{"content":"PyCon 2017 Youtube Video\nThe first ever PyCon Conference in Kenya was held USIU-Africa from September 28-29 2017. The conference brought together software developers techies, business pepple startups, learning institutions and others that have either an interest or a stake in the open source python programming language, and related technologies in its ecosystem.\nThe presentation can be downloaded here.\nAIKenya Show And Tell 2019 AI Kenya is a fast growing community aimed at bringing together like-minded people to discuss, build and grow the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science ecosystem in Kenya and East Africa.\nThe presentation was about Behavioral Clonning\nThe goals of this project shall be:\n Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track. Summarize the results with a written report  In this project, I will use what i\u0026amp;rsquo;ve learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior.\nI will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.\nThe cool guys over at Udacity have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.\nThis is the Show \u0026amp;amp; Tell which happened on March 9th where I gave a talk about Autonomous Vehicles.
