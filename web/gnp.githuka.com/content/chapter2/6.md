from Ksh.5000 upto Ksh.20,000. These devices offer the same Android experience as a mobile device
hence user experience really needs no re-learning. The brand names varry as well and some really
have no specific brands. Online stores locally will mark them as Generic 2DIN 9.0” Android 8.x Car 
Stereo Radio MP5 Player. The MP5 mention is just as amusing to say the least.

The head units come with Android 8.0 and will have necessary media experience with easy intergration
to mobile devices, a step ahead from the stock head units that come with vehicles.
