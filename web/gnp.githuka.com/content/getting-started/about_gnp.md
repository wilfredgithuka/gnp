## Safety is Important

This is a research project and the vehicle above has been modified to perform what you see in this project. Do not attempt to replicate what you see
here on your car. It can result in voiding your vehicle's warranty, insurance or even cause injury. Consult a professional vehicle service shop when in doubt.
Keep your eyes on the road at all times and follow the rules of the road.

### Electrical Safety

* The starting current of the starter can reach upto 120A DC. This is very dangerous.
* Do not short circuit the battery terminals.
* Do not leave the car battery at a lower voltage for too long.
* Have a secondary battery to power your peripherals. 
* Leave the primary battery just for starting the engine.
