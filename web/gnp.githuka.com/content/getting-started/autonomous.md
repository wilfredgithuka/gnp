A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV), driverless car, or robotic car (robo-car),is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.The future of this technology may have an impact on multiple industries and other circumstances.

Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.

Possible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, and connected vehicle platoons.Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development, but there are no self-driving cars available for everyday consumers.
