The first ever PyCon Conference in Kenya was held [USIU-Africa](https://www.usiu.ac.ke/) from September 28-29 2017. The conference brought together software developers techies, business pepple startups, learning institutions and others that have either an interest or a stake in the open source python programming language, and related technologies in its ecosystem.

## AIKenya Show And Tell 2019

[AI Kenya](https://kenya.ai/) is a fast growing community aimed at bringing together like-minded people to discuss, 
build and grow the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science ecosystem in Kenya and East Africa.

The presentation was about Behavioral Clonning

The goals of this project shall be:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

In this project, I will use what i've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. 

I will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The cool guys over at Udacity have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. I'll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.


This is the Show & Tell which happened on March 9th where I gave a talk about Autonomous Vehicles. The presentation is available
in the [git repo](https://github.com/wilfredgithuka/ai-kenya-show-and-tell) and/or can be downloaded [directly here](https://gnp.githuka.com/presentations/ai-ke-st-2019.pptx).
