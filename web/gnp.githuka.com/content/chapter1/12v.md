The vehicle's 12V power system is the primary source of electromotive force that is requred to operate most loads in the vehicle.
Since the loads varry in resistance, the current drawn is also a variable and changes depending on the load turned on. The
source of this energy is the 12V Lead Acid Battery and the alternator. These work in charging and discharging states.
