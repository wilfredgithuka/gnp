The car battery is a flooded lead acid battery. It consists of a Lead -ve electrode and a Lead Dioxide +ve electrode dipped in an 
electrolyte made of dilute sulphiric acid. The plates separator is made of a glass fibre which is essentially Silicon Dioxide. 
The outercase is made of ABS plastic. On most batteries the terminals are made of silver-coated copper.
