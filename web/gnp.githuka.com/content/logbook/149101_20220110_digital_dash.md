The Speedometer, odometer, trip meter, tachometer and fuel gauge are controlled by the unified meter control unit,
which is built into the combination meter. The Warning lamp and indicator lamp are controlled by signals drawn from the CAN bus,
BCM (body control module), and components connected directly to the combination meter.The spedometer is controlled by an ABS actuator and electric 
unit (control unit) converses a pulse signal from wheel sensor to vehicle speed signal, and transmit vehicle speed signal to combination meter via the CAN bus. 
The Combination meter then converses the vehicle speed signal to angle, and commands to speedometer.

The combination meter is analogue and am thinking of replacing the whole unit with a digital screen.

Before even thining too much into the concept, its important to understand how its all connected.

For indocators and displays which get input from the CAN Bus, the resultant digital render shall be quit simple.

Much more on this for a later date...
