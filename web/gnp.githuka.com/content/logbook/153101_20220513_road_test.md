Updated build inverted to show all the individual systems. From the Left to Right: Drive Computer, Power Supply, CAN Bus Unit and Network Support Unit.

The system now in its actual place, away from luggage and other objects. The visible zip ties is something that needs work.

This log is a quick update to some upgrade work that I have been working on this week. I have been having challenges of devices
falling or getting disconnected so I decided to use zip ties and hot glue to hold everything in place. Network cables have been shortened
and all connections have been bonded.

## Power Supply

* 12V 10A Fuse Tap from front fuse panel
* 300W DC-DC Constant Current Constant Voltage Buck Converter
* 12V to 19V for Drive Computer
* 12V to 5V x2 for CAN Bus Sensing Unit and Network Support Unit

## Drive Computer

* Power Requirements: 19V 3.4A, 64.6W
* Added power button switch
* Held in place by zip ties

## Network Support Unit

* Held in place by hot glue
* Shotnened network cables
* Powered by 5V <1.5A

## CAN Bus Sensiing Unit

* Held in place by hot glue
* Noticed possibility of underpowering
* CAN Module MCP 2515 is input cable runs from OBD port to back

This new build design should hold for a while as more improvements are in the works.
