This weekend's TODO list was quit full. I managed to achieve some of the tasks but others just needed more time. Have a look below:

* [X] Update system and solve kernel panic issues
* [X] Install & Configure [Olive Tin](https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin)
* [X] Power Management
* [X] Improve Build Quality
* [ ] Nissan Note CAN Bus DBC File
* [X] Learn

## [SOLVED] Update System & Solve Kernel Panic Issues

So the drive-computer has been having some kernel panic issues for the last 1 month or so. The system will hang during ssh
sessions which necessitates a reboot. When I pluged in a screen I saw the following errors:

```
[58648.430056] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 3c on CPU 0.
[58648.430063] Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
[58648.430065] Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
[58648.409794] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 2c on CPU 0.
[58648.409800] Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
[58648.409803] Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
```
I dropped down to BIOS and changed the power settings to PERFORMANCE ignoring the battery usage.

The errors seemed to have gone for now, ssh is fine and scp even transfers upto 20GB without any issues.

So an update was in order:

```
sudo pacman -Syu

```

## OliveTin


![vehicle](https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin/raw/main/media/screenshotDesktop.png)

https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin

OliveTin gives safe and simple access to predefined shell commands from a web interface

OliveTin is the control interface for the drive computer when sitting at the drivers seat.

It offers a platform for rebooting, sleeping, stopping and starting systemd services.

I installed it and plan to use it for:

* Control CAN Start/Stop recording
* Camera Control
* Rebooting the drive computer etc.

## Power Management

The drive-computer's battery pack can last for 5 hours, which is preety impressive.

I have deided to be putting it on Suspend mode which results is faster wake up time.

```
sudo systemctl suspend
```

## Improve Build Quality

![vehicle](/images/weekend_build.jpg)

The improved build over the weekend seems to hold up well. Speed bumps on the new Waiyaki Way produce
vibrations which have no effect on the connections as well as the general build itself. 

Sustained vibrations over a long period might reveal the weakness of the bonds.


## Nissan Note CAN Bus DBC File

The search for the Nissan Note e11 CAN DBC File is still on. I have scoured forums, groups and even
engaged professionals but there seems to be no one with the file. This vehicle is simply not a reverse
engineer'playtool.


Much of the above project are still on the way, abit far from completion, so this week I need to spare
some more time to finish them.
